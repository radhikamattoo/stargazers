# Instructions for Milestone 2
Run the program using nodemon bin/ww, and go to localhost:3000.

# Add data/Research Topic  - localhost:3000
To demonstrate adding a User document to the users collection, you can
sign up with whatever username/password combo you like.

To demonstrate implementation of Passport, one of my research topics, you can login to the existing account, which passport will verify and console.log("Authenticated!"):

Go to localhost:3000
Click the "Already a user? Sign In" button.
Login with:

username: radhika
password: helloWorld


# Reading data - localhost:3000/radhika/nasa/archive

After signing up/in, you'll be directed to a workshopped profile page, with a link
to the NASA Archive. Clicking this link will bring you to a page of the entire dataset,
and will let you query it using a GET form.
